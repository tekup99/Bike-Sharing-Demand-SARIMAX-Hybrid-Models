This indicates that the SARIMAX model captures the fundamental patterns in the data well at the start. However, the model struggles to predict the subsequent downward trend, leading to deviations in its forecasts.\n\nOverall, the plot shows that the SARIMAX(0,1,2)(1,0,0)[30] model makes reasonable predictions initially but fails to anticipate the reverse trend accurately. This suggests that while the model captures some of the seasonal and trend components in the data, it may require further refinement to improve its predictive performance for unexpected changes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The aim is to enhance the forecasting performance of the SARIMAX model by testing various hybrid models. These hybrid models will combine the residuals from the SARIMAX model with different machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, GBM, and RandomForest. The goal is to apply these advanced regression algorithms to the residuals left by the SARIMAX model, thereby capturing any remaining patterns or nonlinearities that the initial model might have missed. Each machine learning algorithm brings its unique strengths: XGBoost's robustness and scalability, CatBoost's ability to handle categorical features, LightGBM's speed and efficiency, GBM's simplicity, and RandomForest's capacity to deal with overfitting. By combining the time-series capabilities of SARIMAX with the powerful predictive performance of these machine learning models, the aim is to achieve more accurate and reliable forecasts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# SARIMAX AND HYBRID MODELS","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sarimax_rmse <- rmse(actual_values, sarimax_pred)\n\n# XGBoost\ndtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = exog_matrix_train, label = residuals_train)\ndtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = exog_matrix_test)\n\n\n\nxgboost_model <- xgboost(data = dtrain, nrounds = 100, objective = \"reg:squarederror\", verbose = 0)\nxgboost_residuals <- predict(xgboost_model, dtest)\nxgboost_pred <- sarimax_pred + xgboost_residuals\nxgboost_rmse <- rmse(actual_values, xgboost_pred)\n\n# CatBoost\ncatboost_pool_train <- catboost.load_pool(data = exog_matrix_train, label = residuals_train)\ncatboost_pool_test <- catboost.load_pool(data = exog_matrix_test)\n\ncatboost_model <- catboost.train(catboost_pool_train, params = list(iterations = 100, loss_function = 'RMSE', verbose = 0))\ncatboost_residuals <- catboost.predict(catboost_model, catboost_pool_test)\ncatboost_pred <- sarimax_pred + catboost_residuals\ncatboost_rmse <- rmse(actual_values, catboost_pred)\n\n# LightGBM\nlightgbm_train <- lgb.Dataset(data = exog_matrix_train, label = residuals_train)\nlightgbm_params <- list(objective = \"regression\", metric = \"rmse\")\n\nlightgbm_model <- lgb.train(params = lightgbm_params, data = lightgbm_train, nrounds = 100, verbose = 0)\nlightgbm_residuals <- predict(lightgbm_model, exog_matrix_test)\nlightgbm_pred <- sarimax_pred + lightgbm_residuals\nlightgbm_rmse <- rmse(actual_values, lightgbm_pred)\n\n# GBM\ngbm_model <- gbm(residuals_train ~ ., data = as.data.frame(exog_matrix_train), distribution = \"gaussian\", n.trees = 100, interaction.depth = 3, shrinkage = 0.1, verbose = FALSE)\ngbm_residuals <- predict(gbm_model, as.data.frame(exog_matrix_test), n.trees = 100)\ngbm_pred <- sarimax_pred + gbm_residuals\ngbm_rmse <- rmse(actual_values, gbm_pred)\n\n# RandomForest\nrf_model <- randomForest(residuals_train ~ ., data = as.data.frame(exog_matrix_train), ntree = 100)\nrf_residuals <- predict(rf_model, as.data.frame(exog_matrix_test))\nrf_pred <- sarimax_pred + rf_residuals\nrf_rmse <- rmse(actual_values, rf_pred)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rmse_values <- data.frame(\n  Model = c(\"SARIMAX\", \"SARIMAX + XGBoost\", \"SARIMAX + CatBoost\", \"SARIMAX + LightGBM\", \"SARIMAX + GBM\", \"SARIMAX + RandomForest\"),\n  RMSE = c(sarimax_rmse, xgboost_rmse, catboost_rmse, lightgbm_rmse, gbm_rmse, rf_rmse)\n)\n\nkable(rmse_values, format = \"markdown\", col.names = c(\"Model\", \"RMSE\"))\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The table presents the RMSE values for the baseline SARIMAX model and its hybrid versions with various machine learning techniques.
